MD Preview

<p align="center">
Neovim plugin for hot-reload rendering of markdown in the browser.
</p>

---

## Features

- **CommonMark**: uses [goldmark](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/yuin/goldmark@v1.7.8), which is CommonMark 0.31.2 compliant.
- **Hackable**: a tiny codebase makes it easy to modify and extend.
- **Images**: embed local images with base64 encoding.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: highlight fenced code blocks.

### Dependencies

- [Plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Getting Started

Using [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
return {
    "rainstf/mdpreview",
    dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' },
    opts = {
        events = {
            reload_on = 'InsertLeave',
            scrolling = false
        }
    },
    keys = {
        { "<leader>ms", "<cmd>MdPreviewStart<cr>" },
        { "<leader>mf", "<cmd>MdPreviewStop<cr>" }
    }
}
```

You may omit the lazy-loading `keys` spec and call the user commands directly instead.


### Building MDPreview Server

This plugin uses a binary executable file to communicate with Neovim and host a web server. It does not come pre-built, so you will need a Go compiler to build it

> [!CAUTION]
> Before running anything, please verify its contents. It's never a good idea to blindly execute scripts/commands—especially ones found on the internet.

```bash
cd $HOME/.local/share/nvim/lazy/mdpreview && bash ./install.sh
```

The above shell command automates the build and install process, but performing it manually might be safer.

### Build It Manually

Alternatively, you could execute the commands:

1. `cd $HOME/.local/share/nvim/lazy/mdpreview/binary`

Navigate to binary/ in the directory the package manager cloned. For lazy.nvim, cloned plugins are usually found in ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/

2. `go mod tidy && go build .`

Ensure all dependencies the binary requires are downloaded. Then build it.

3. `sudo cp ./MDPreview /usr/bin`

Add it to a directory in PATH. This may require root privileges depending on the location.

**If uninstalling**, remember to delete the binary executable file.

## Configuration

Configuration is currently limited.

```lua
opts = {
    events = {
        reload_on = 'InsertLeave',
        scrolling = false
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Synchronized scrolling is experimental and may not be accurate.

- `reload_on`: Neovim event used to reload the page.
You may specify Neovim events (:h events) for the reload method.
For instance, use 'TextChangedI' to update the page content on each keystroke.

- `scrolling`: Controls automatic page scroll.

### Extending Functionality / Design

The small codebase makes hacking on MDPreview simple and ensures only essential features get implemented. Currently, there's only ~500 LOC and the project will likely never exceed 1k SLOC.

**For example,**

To change the appearance of the web page, modify the CSS in `binary/internal/css.go`.

## How This Works

MDPreview consists of two components—a Lua script and a Go binary.

**Why It Matters**: Understanding the plugin-server interaction is crucial if you encounter issues.

Once both components are set up, you can interact with the plugin via its Lua API. The server, a binary executable file, is spawned as a user process and managed by the Lua component. Configuration changes are loaded when the server is spawned. Importantly, these three actions kill the server:

1. Closing the buffer from which it was spawned.
1. Calling the MdPreviewStop command.
1. Closing Neovim.

The buffer's content is sent—on the reload event—to the server over an [nvim channel](https://neovim.io/doc/user/channel.html). The server converts the markdown into HTML and sends it to the client (your browser) for rendering using [Server Sent Events (SSE)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html).
